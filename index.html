	<h2>Biography</h2>
	
      <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Computer Science, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT, Beijing China), 
	      advised by <a href="https://teacher.bupt.edu.cn/mahuadong">Prof. Huadong Ma</a>.
	      I am also an affiliated member of Beijing Key Lab of Intelligent Telecommunication Software and Multimedia.
	      I am currently majoring in Computer Science and Technology and expect to receive my PhD in November 2023.
	      <!--I received the B.S. degree from Qingdao University in 2018. -->
      </p>
  	
	<p>My research covers the broad field of Internet of Things (IoT) and Mobile Computing, 
		with special interests in 5G/Beyond-5G/6G networks, Time-sensitive Networking (TSN), and Network Measurement.
		My works have been published in top international conferences and journals such as ACM SIGCOMM, ACM MobiCom, ACM UbiComp, 
		IEEE/ACM TON, IEEE TMC, and IEEE TWC.
      </p>
